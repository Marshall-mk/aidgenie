Empowering Health Care, One Byte at a Time!

## Problem Statement
The scarcity of reliable medical data from developing countries, particularly in regions like Nigeria and other parts of Africa, poses a significant challenge and contributes to bias in medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This challenge primarily stems from inadequate data management practices and the difficulty in accessing patient records, hindering organizations that rely on such data. Addressing this problem is crucial to foster unbiased and effective medical AI solutions.

## Mission
Our mission is to alleviate the shortage of medical data from developing countries by developing a robust platform and data warehouse. We aim to empower healthcare professionals, including doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and other medical personnel, with a comprehensive solution for secure and convenient storage, retrieval, and utilization of medical data. Our goal is to enhance data availability and accessibility, while ensuring privacy protection through advanced anonymization techniques.

## Vision
Our vision is to create an inclusive global healthcare landscape where high-quality medical data from developing countries is readily accessible and seamlessly integrated into AI-driven healthcare solutions. We envision a future where healthcare professionals can leverage our sophisticated platform to efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze patient data. By providing robust data preprocessing capabilities and advanced redaction functionalities, we aim to facilitate the ethical utilization of medical data, ultimately leading to improved research, accurate diagnoses, and advancements in healthcare outcomes.
